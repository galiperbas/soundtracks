Summary: Barro is a simple arcade racing game for one or two players (in split-screen). Players can race on nineteen tracks in different weather conditions against three CPU opponents (or two in two-player mode) or do a time trial solo. Track profiles go up and down wildly and many of them loop over. Running off the track is the main danger in the game and once you do that, your car disappears and resets back to the track.
