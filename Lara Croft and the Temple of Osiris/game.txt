Summary: Lara Croft and the Temple of Osiris is the sequel to Lara Croft and the Guardian of Light, and the second game in a spin-off from the main Tomb Raider series. The two-player cooperative campaign from the first game is expanded to support up to four players. They need to work together in a platform environment to explore the temple, defeat hordes of enemies from the Egyptian underworld, solve puzzles, and avoid traps, using a high-angle perspective like the previous game. When playing together, the level lay-outs change to support cooperative actions.
