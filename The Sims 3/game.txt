Summary: The Sims 3 is a console game, developed by Edge of Reality and published by Electronic Arts for the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3.

For the first time ever, players could upload and download content via Xbox Live and PlayStation Network, including player creations from the Exchange for free, and new items released by EA, which costed a fee. As of July 2018, the Exchange for consoles has been shut down.

Much like The Sims 2 for PSP, the game has been removed from Xbox Marketplace and PlayStation Store, meaning that the digital version is only available to download to players who have previously buy it. The same applies to the Pets variant.
