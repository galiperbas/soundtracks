Summary: Pick from the Ten Heroes, each with there own Special as they tackle wave after wave of enemies, and discover the best combos to do it with! This is by far my best game so far and I realy hope you agree, have fun playing it, if you do that, I've succeded! P.S. Some enemies attack from behind and others apear in waves, so unless "GO" flashes on your screen, theres killing to be had!

Genre: Fighting, Hack and slash/Beat 'em up
