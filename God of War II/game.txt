The game is rooted in Greek mythology and unfolds in ancient Greece, revolving around the theme of vengeance. The protagonist, Kratos, is the new God of War, having defeated the former, Ares. However, Kratos is betrayed by Zeus, the King of the Olympian gods, who not only strips him of his godhood but also kills him.

These entities have the power to enable time travel, allowing Kratos to prevent his betrayal, and ultimately seek revenge on Zeus.
