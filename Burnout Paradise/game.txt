Summary: Evolve or die. For Paradise, we knew we had to change everything.

Burnout was a killer arcade driving game, but for a new generation of hardware and connected player Burnout had to become something more ambitious.

Closed tracks made way for an expansive, open city, and we seamlessly synced your friends into the action and let you loose on a heap of cool challenges that unsurprisingly rewarded you for driving like a lunatic. Hey, itâ€™s us after all.

Genre: Racing

Theme: Action, Sandbox, Open world
