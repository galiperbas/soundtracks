Summary: The retro-futuristic pixel game

Explore and fight in a retro-futuristic world. Swim deep into a oneiric, poetic and unique experience across dimensional planes.

The aesthetic of the game was inspired by retro pixel adventures (Castlevania, Another World, Double Dragon) with a modern touch (Superbrothers, Sword and Sorcery) and an 80s plot homage (Ready Player One, He-Man, The Last Starfighter), accompanied by the retro synth touch of the old glory days.
