Summary: You control a family of characters one at a time, and when your character dies, you choose who his or her successor is, whether it is a barbarian son of yours who has OCD, your daughter who became a ninja even though she can't see well, an assassin who is fighting for the gays, or a miner who wants to collect gold! Traits are randomized each time upon death, leading to multiple playthroughs with 35 traits, each character will be unique.
