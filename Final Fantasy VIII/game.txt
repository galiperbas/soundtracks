Summary: The Steam version of Final Fantasy VIII comes with several in-game enhancements, including a speed-up option to fast-forward through cutscenes and FMVs and built-in cheats, such as Battle Assist, making battles almost impossible to lose. Like Final Fantasy VII, the re-release version comes with the Magic Booster feature that allows players to boost their characters' magics to 100. Achievements and cloud save data storage are also available. Windowed mode and high-resolution displays (up to 1920x1080 @ 60 Hz) are now supported. However, the game still uses the original MIDI tracks from the 1999 version, rather than the PlayStation version music, unlike the 2012 re-released Final Fantasy VII which has received a musical update. Chocobo World is playable directly from the launcher after booting Final Fantasy VIII.
