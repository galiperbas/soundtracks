Summary: Contagion takes place in a fictional world where the original Roanoke Colony thrived up until now. A contagion of unknown origins has infected the locals turning them into a mindless horde of flesh eating zombies. It is up to the remaining survivors to escape, extract, or hunt one another if they are to survive the horrors they now face. Contagion isn't your average Zombie Shooter but instead takes a more realistic and different approach to the popular genre with unique characters, environments, weapons, items, and a built in system that makes every round completely unpredictable with resources, objectives, and paths ever changing.
