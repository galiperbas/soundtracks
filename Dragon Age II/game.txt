Summary: Dragon Age II is the sequel to Dragon Age: Origins and the second major game in the series. Like its predecessor, players can explore and engage in combat from a third-person perspective and will also encounter various companions who play major roles in the plot and gameplay. Depending on players' decisions and dialogue, a companion will either recognize the main character Hawke as a friend or a rival. The game adopts the wheel-based dialogue system, meaning short responses that reflect different tones and attitudes the player wishes to choose for Hawke. The combat system is quite similar to the one used in the previous Dragon Age game, though it has been noticeably sped up.
