Summary: The Swapper is a short puzzle platformer where you must complete every puzzle and collect 124 orbs, in groups of 3 and 9 later on, to complete the game.

The game has a tool which lets you create up to 4 clones and switch between them as long as you have a clear line of sight.

The main obstacles for the puzzles are 3 kinds of lights that interfere with the tool in different ways to make the puzzles harder.

Achievements/Trophies are tied to hidden consoles instead of story progress so a guide will most likely be needed to find all 10.
