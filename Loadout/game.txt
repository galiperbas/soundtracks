Summary: Loadout is an outrageous new multi-player shooter that’s all about the guns, baby! Build a massive variety of absolutely insane weaponry - billions of combinations - totally customized, totally unique, and totally deadly.

Our robust and modular Weaponcrafting system allows players to make their own weapons from a wide variety of weapon parts, and then modify their entire arsenal to suit their play style. There are no defined classes in Loadout. You define your own class through the weapons you create.

Loadout is also loaded with over-the-top comedic violence, stylish character models, and crazy player animations. We aim to add a fresh, new look to the shooter experience that gives players a full-adrenaline rush that is totally different from the vast array of modern combat titles. From our hilariously gory damage system, to our wacky character customizations, Loadout will appeal to the lunatic in us all. But don’t let the demented humor fool you. At its core, Loadout is a fast-paced shooter that’s easy to learn, but hard to master.
